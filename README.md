# Calculator

Goal: 
Create a calculator in the web page using HTML, CSS, JS with the following functions:
1) Add
2) Subtract
3) Multiply
4) Divide
5) Clear

Lessons Learned:
Applied HTML, CSS, JS foundations to create a calculator from scratch!  Learned
how to use arrow functions and event variables for the first time, got more
experience using eventListeners and DOM manipulation, applied ternary operators,
dot notation, switch/case statements and more to create logic functions.  Pseudocode
is very important, even when adding on more functions to existing code.
